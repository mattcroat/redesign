## üßë‚Äçüé® What is Joy of Code?

[Joy of Code](https://joyofcode.xyz/) is a digital garden growing curious minds with a vide variety of topics from web development to web design.

## ü§ó Contribute

**First time contributors are welcome** ‚Äî in fact this is the reason why I made it possible for others to edit posts and contribute.

At the end of each post there's a direct link to the **Markdown** file of the post you can edit inside GitHub.

You can read the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn more.

## üß≠ Technologies

- ‚ö°Ô∏è [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) is used for the frontend with server-side rendering and plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) is used to manage content by using GitHub as a content management system
- The editor is also made with SvelteKit and takes advantage of the GitHub API and uses [Monaco](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor) as the editor to manage content
- Posts are stored inside the `posts` folder and are used to build the page using the GitHub API but `data` is where metadata about posts is stored in a single `posts.json` to serve as a database

## Setup

The project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) but you can use any other package manager.
